# Identifying low-performing analyses at a veterinary clinic

The investigation was carried out using Python v. 3.7.3 and Jupyter Notebook. The .ipynb file is available for download along with the dataset folder, containing 7 .csv files. The notebook can also be visualised on its own through GitHub, or, should it not load properly, [as an HTML page](https://alepoptosis.github.io/vet_clinic_analysis/vet_clinic_analysis.html).

## Introduction

Most veterinary clinics routinely run a wide range of analyses for their clients, such as blood counts, microbial swabs, or biochemical profiles. These tests require dedicated materials, which need to be regularly purchased, as well as a variety of devices, which require specialised maintenance. With many tests being run every week, it is easy to lose track of whether the cost of materials and maintenance is being sufficiently offset by the proceeds of these analyses. This information could be used by the veterinary clinic to evaluate whether the price or frequency of certain analyses needs to be adjusted, or whether it would be more cost-effective to outsource low-performing analyses to external laboratories.
